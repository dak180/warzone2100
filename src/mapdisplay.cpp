	MapDisplay - Renders the world view necessary for the intelligence map
	Alex McLean, Pumpkin Studios, EIDOS Interactive, 1997

	Makes heavy use of the functions available in display3d.c. Could have
	messed about with display3d.c to make to world render dual purpose, but
	it's neater as a separate file, as the intelligence map has special requirements
	and overlays and needs to render to a specified buffer for later use.
